# NextVpower
Next V-Power, adapted from "Virus Phylogenetic Resolver of Wastewater-based Epidemiology (V-Power).
=======
Next V-Power is a tool for SARS-CoV-2 lineage demixing from multiplex sequencing data, for wastewater and other mixed samples.

Basic flow sheet:

Note: Red numbers indicate adjustable parameters. Green numbers may change according to your sequencing data and the updating of the barcode matrix A.


Requirements:
---------------
 - python3
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - cvxpy

This tool was developed on Windows, and tested on Linux.

Installation:
---------------
1.Clone this repository to your local directory. 

2.Install requiments in a python environment. Skip if you have reached these requirments.
```sh
pip install numpy pandas cvxpy
```
3.Change directory to where you cloned this repository to.
```sh
cd /path/of/NextVpower #example path
```
4.Unzip `usher_barcodes.zip` and `var_anno.zip` under current directory.
Output files should be `usher_barcodes.csv` and `var_anno.csv`. 
Using unpacking software may be more convenient. 
```sh
unzip usher_barcodes.zip
```
```sh
unzip var_anno.zip
```
 - For Windows, please unzip these two files to the folder where they are located.

5.Run python command to check installation and see help.
```sh
python NextVpower.py -h
```

> [!NOTE]
> `usher_barcodes.csv` was generated via [Freyja](https://github.com/andersen-lab/Freyja) and this file was copied from [Freyja repository](https://github.com/andersen-lab/Freyja/blob/main/freyja/data/usher_barcodes.csv).
>
> `var_anno.csv` was downloaded from [NGDC: RCoV19 - Variation Annotation](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ncov/variation/annotation) and I made some format convertion on it.

> [!NOTE]
> `Vpower.m` and `Vpower2.m` are MATLAB scripts of V-Power.
>
> `NextVpower.py` is a standalone program, which has integrated the function of `Vpower.m` and `Vpower2.m` without using MATLAB engine.

Usage: 
---------------

1. Demix from input sample table file, and save result to result.tsv:
```sh
python NextVpower.py -i PP_raw_example.tsv -o demix_result_example.tsv
```
2. Demix from input *.vcf files under a folder, filter mutation sites with mutation rate lower than 0.1, filter mutation sites with depth lower than 10, and save result to result.tsv:
```sh
python NextVpower.py -i vcf_example -v -r 0.1 -d 10 -o demix_result_vcf_example.tsv
```
3. Set barcode filter criteria, retain "key" mutation sites present in more than 300 lineages (default 200), filter lineages with fewer than 30 "key" mutation sites (default 20):
```sh
python NextVpower.py -i PP_raw_example.tsv -n 30 -k 300 -o demix_result_example_300_30.tsv
```
4. Add annotation to *.vcf files according to variation annotation table and demix:
```sh
python NextVpower.py -i vcf_example -v -o demix_result_vcf_example.tsv --ann_outpath ann_tab_example
```
5. Demix from input *.vcf files under a folder, save result in result.tsv, and save middle data to files:
```sh
python NextVpower.py -i vcf_example -v -o demix_result_vcf_example.tsv --vcsample PP_raw_example.tsv --fbarcode MMFF_example.tsv --fsample PPFF_example.tsv --potentials potential_sites_example.tsv
```

Please see detailed usage by running `python NextVpower.py -h` or in [source code](NextVpower.py)

> [!TIP]
> How to create VCF files?
> 
> - 1.Align sample.reads.fq to NC_045512_Hu-1.fasta (or MN908947.3.fasta) by running `bwa mem`, `samtools sort` and `samtools view`, to generate sample.bam.
> 
> - 2.Use variant calling tools (freebayes, bcftools, etc.) to generate sample.vcf from sample.bam.
